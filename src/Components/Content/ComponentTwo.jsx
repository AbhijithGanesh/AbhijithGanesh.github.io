            <li>I am an enthusiastic High-schooler (Grade 12 Student) who is interested in learning about new tech and I'm highly passionate about learning principles of the modern-day business world. I love airplanes and I'm very much interested learning about flights and everything related to aviation. Being an avid Formula One fan, I support the Mercedes Petronas AMG F1 Team and the entire sporting fraternity. Cars in-general are beautiful and its obvious that one would enjoy their weekend in a vintage car. If you guys see a Mercedes 500K anywhere please reach out through the Contact me.</li>

                    Apart from Dev, Formula One and Tech, I do workout sometimes. Being locked at home for sometime because of the pandemic, I leant how to cook and enjoy the scenery around.Its amazing to re-learn old perspectives and explore new.

                    My Aviation Interests: To start it all of, Its sad that the industry has taken huge hit because of the pandemic. We have lost the Queen of the skies, Airbus A380 in large quantities. I've enjoyed seeing commercial Jets since 2015 roughly. Enjoyed seeing Air Crash Investigations and Learning about components of Aircraft. Apart from the documentary series and Internet, I'vent learnt a lot through experience and I am eagerly looking forward to it soon. Possibly after the Flight Volumes pick off.
